# These are a list of TODOs for the project

1. Text wrapping on CodeWriter
2. Code Block update statement to use `$[` and `$]`
3. Support positional arguments in CodeBlock and others
4. Add support for dictionary arguments in CodeBlock and others
5. Name Allocator if we so desire (?)
6. Annotation member has to be valid java identifier
7. Multiple imports with same ClassName should use package name
8. Handle primitive types better in ClassName i.e. validation
9. Improve tests with exact output strings and also slim down unneeded tests
10. Pass in TypeSpec for Types as well (for nested classes) ? It might work and we can include a self key too
